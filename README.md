# python-maze-solving-algorithm

A project from a data structures and algorithms class. This program takes in a text-formatted maze and uses a depth first search to traverse the maze. It makes use of nested objects, stacks, and queues. A stack is used for finding a path to the exit, and a queue is used at the end of the traversal to print out the path that was taken.
